SHLOK YAMDAGNI

I don’t operate like a typical college coder doing tutorial copy-paste. I build systems with first principles. Networking, cybersecurity, infra logic — that’s the zone where I think long term and where most people don’t have the patience or depth to go.
Machine Learning, AI and overall Computer Science exploration is parallel because tech isn’t religion — it’s a toolbox. I use what creates real value. Execution matters… noise doesn’t.

WHAT I DO

Networking + Cybersecurity Enthusiast
Learning ML/AI and applying it practically
Building projects in Python, Flask, HTML/CSS etc.
Solving problems from business angle, not textbook angle

PRINCIPLE

Clarity > Fluff.
Systems > Hype.
Execution > Excuses.

I appreciate progress… but I fix weaknesses ruthlessly and without sugarcoating.

PROJECTS
Movie Recommender System (Flask)
Content-based movie recommendation web app using Kaggle dataset (10,000 movies). Flask served, similarity driven results, made for real utility not classroom theory.

Student Grade Management System
Clean fundamental system for academic records handling. Good foundation practice in backend discipline and data structuring.

Voice-Based Laptop Controlling Assistant (JARVIS Style) (In Progress)
Voice input → System command execution. Practical interface experiment at the intersection of ML + OS control + automation.

CURRENT GOALS

Get deeper in cybersecurity + networking real world setups
Build more system-level projects (infra > toy ML demos)
Ship consistently & publicly
